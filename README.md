 This project was created as part of the Summer of Making competition. Through building it, I’ve learned a lot about Django, one of the most popular Python web frameworks, and how to structure applications using its models, views, and templates system.

I also gained hands-on experience with SQLite, which I used as the database backend for this project. Working with migrations, queries, and managing data storage gave me a deeper understanding of how web applications handle information behind the scenes.

Beyond just coding, this project helped me improve my problem-solving, debugging, and project management skills. It represents both a learning journey and a step toward building more advanced applications in the future.

I’m excited to continue experimenting, learning, and growing as a developer, and this project marks just the beginning of that journey.
