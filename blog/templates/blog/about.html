    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
        This project was created as part of the <strong>Summer of Making</strong> competition.
        Through building it, I’ve learned a lot about <strong>Django</strong>, one of the most
        popular Python web frameworks, and how to structure applications using its models, views,
        and templates system.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also gained hands-on experience with <strong>SQLite</strong>, which I used as the database
        backend for this project. Working with migrations, queries, and managing data storage gave me
        a deeper understanding of how web applications handle information behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond just coding, this project helped me improve my problem-solving, debugging, and
        project management skills. It represents both a learning journey and a step toward building
        more advanced applications in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m excited to continue experimenting, learning, and growing as a developer, and this project
        marks just the beginning of that journey.
